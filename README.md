# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Week-4-Project
Week 4 Peer Graded Project for the Coursera Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Peer Graded Project

Submission includes:
1) a tidy data set
2) a Github repository link to a script for performing the analysis
3) a Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4)A README file explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The data for the project was obtained from this location:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The R script for running the analysis is called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
